                <div class="blurb">
                    <p>My name is <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cherylmiyake/">Cheryl Miyake</a>, and I’m passionate about inspiring and 
                        empowering people through innovative learning experiences. I am 
                        constantly learning from the people around me and sharing new 
                        found knowledge and skills with others.</p>
                    <p>My experience as a designer, educator, and instructional 
                        technology leader enables me to empathize and advocate for youth, 
                        teachers, policy makers, and families. Growing up on an island and 
                        moving to the mainland for school and work allows me to understand 
                        the importance of grassroots efforts and bring them to scale.</p>
                    <p>I strive to apply UX/UI design principles to everyday problems at 
                        work and in my spare time. I’m a big-picture thinker and aim to 
                        design experiences end-to-end, from empathizing with users to 
                        measuring key performance indicators.</p>

                    <p>Humans are built to learn. We learn best when we feel comfortable 
                        to take risks, learn with others, and have agency to follow our 
                        curiosities. I am constantly striving to stay within my Zone of 
                        Proximal Development via travel, partnering with and mentoring 
                        others, listening to podcasts, reading up on new design and 
                        pedagogical trends, and getting my hands dirty with new projects.</p>

                        individuals striving to make our world a more inclusive and vibrant 
                        place. I am only one person, and I only have one life to live. I strive

                        with people and advocate for their needs. It’s important to scale grassroots 
                        efforts - people impacted by problems should have the key to their solutions. 
                        I design for all fringe cases to create a more equitable society where we

                    <p>Each of us change everyday. We may not always want or be ready for change. 
                        Having a growth mindset and big-picture point of view helps me to positively 
                        respond to change. I sustainably design solutions by reflecting on past 
                        mistakes and garnering insights. Weighing all potential outcomes and their 
                        impact on people help me prioritize the best solutions.</p>

                <h1>Testimonials</h1>
                <p>Cheryl Miyake is a highly valued member of our diverse Cherry Chase School 
                    community who has taught 4th grade here since August 2014. For all of those years 
                    I have had the privilege to work with Cheryl as her principal and have greatly 
                    appreciated her work with students and their families, her collaboration with her 
                    grade-level team of five teachers, and her contributions to our school community 
                    through a variety of district-level leadership roles in addition to her general 
                    willingness to share her own knowledge and new learning with others.</p>
                <p>A passionate, enthusiastic teacher who is deeply committed to student success, 
                    Cheryl creates an effective learning environment where students are held to high 
                    academic expectations as well as supported with their social-emotional needs. 
                    She has been a strong proponent of the growth mindset within her classroom as 
                    she helps students accept mistakes and learn from them. Cheryl has created 
                    routines in her classroom that are equitably implemented, fostering a sense 
                    of purpose and order as all students work to meet or exceed 4th grade Common 
                    Core State Standards, often in small groups that are differentiated according 
                    to student need.</p>
                <p>Cheryl clearly understands that families are our partners in education and 
                    welcomes them into her classroom as volunteers and as witnesses to the shared 
                    learning of our students at publishing parties and other events. She communicates 
                    regularly with families through a classroom website, emails, and formal meetings 
                    – all with a mind to supporting and celebrating student learning. As we have moved 
                    toward deeper integration of technology into instruction, Cheryl has provided 
                    significant leadership in this area: first by embracing the tools that we 
                    provided for use in the classroom (e.g., Chromebooks, iPads, Apple TV) and then 
                    by collaborating with her teammates to identify and implement appropriate ways of 
                    utilizing those with students. She has extended that grade-level work in her 
                    role as one of our Instructional Technology Lead Teachers, as she models use of 
                    tech tools in staff professional development activities and facilitates a Student 
                    Tech Team that provides leadership in activities such as Hour of Code and supports 
                    peers with myriad tech applications in the classroom. More specific information 
                    on the apps she uses is available on her resume.</p>
                <p>Cheryl Miyake has a strong desire to make learning relevant and to provide creative 
                    activities for students that go beyond the basic curriculum. She seeks to educate 
                    and empower students to be lifelong learners, as she herself is.</p>
